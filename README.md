# Harch {Hackers Arch} - A simplistic Arch Linux box with a selection of powerful hacking tools, a lightweight hacker OS!!!

Harch is intended for Security Researchers, preferably those who want to get into Penetration Testing/Ethical Hacking but have an old or slow system... The tools(Downloaded during install or after, your choice) are many of the basic but widely used tools out there! The lightweight Arch design is ideal for this as alot of the bloatware of unneeded applications is not taking up precious resources!

**Works great with HypverV or Virtualbox**

Default Features:

         Shell = Fish
         DeskT = I3/MATE 
         Displ = LightDM
